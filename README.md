## 📌 Project Overview

**MediComforts** is a medical supplies and surgical disposables company aiming to provide custom drape packs and wraps for hospitals and clinics. As part of this freelance project, I designed and developed a professional business website that showcases the company’s product portfolio, company profile, and contact information.

This project was completed independently as a **student freelancer**, following industry standards in responsive design, secure hosting, and SEO basics.
